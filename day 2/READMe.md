Still on HTML
Learnt some basic html formatting, quotations, colors and comments. ✌️
Don't rush to the exotic till you've mastered the basics.✌️
Under HTML Colors, I learnt the different ways colors can be specified which are : RGB, HEX, RSL, RGBA, HSLA

 As @JamesClear
 mentioned in his book, focus on your system of small wins rather than goals. A working system equals happiness 👌
